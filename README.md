#  Playground Book Xcode Project #

Apple Original is here, [READEME.md](https://github.com/sonsongithub/SwiftPlaygroundsAuthorTemplate/blob/master/AppleREADME.md).

## Difference with the original template.

### Support image assets.

This project copies an image assets into `PrivateResources` after creating `car` file using `actool`.
`car` file is created automatically before building the book(see below the screen shot).

<img width="800" alt="create_asset" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/33768/46183024-ee018880-c309-11e8-95a9-98736563fb05.png">

And, image assets is added into LiveViewTest.app.
You can use images in assets in LiveViewTest.app, as well.
